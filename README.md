## Data & Pre-trained Models
Download preprocessed data and our pre-trained models by visiting [OneDrive](https://mail2sysueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/huangyp28_mail2_sysu_edu_cn/EkCFDwd2bQpKtYwyBi3A8ukBHWyNMQ_Tkw9ZeQhYOTMTBA?e=xsMWPO).
We suggest following our data structures, which is consistent with the paths in `config.py`. You may need to modify the `root_path` in `config.py`.
In addition, please following the instructions to prepare some other data:
* Download grid features in path `data/grid_features` provided by X-LXMERT or follow [feature extraction](https://github.com/allenai/x-lxmert/blob/master/feature_extraction/README.md) to extract these features.
  ```
  wget https://ai2-vision-x-lxmert.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/butd_features/COCO/maskrcnn_train_grid8.h5 -P data/grid_features
  wget https://ai2-vision-x-lxmert.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/butd_features/COCO/maskrcnn_valid_grid8.h5 -P data/grid_features
  wget https://ai2-vision-x-lxmert.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/butd_features/COCO/maskrcnn_test_grid8.h5 -P data/grid_features
  ```
* For text-to-image evaluation on MSCOCO dataset, we need the real images to calculate the FID metric.
  For UMT-DBITG, we use MSCOCO karpathy split, which has been included in the OneDrive folder (`images/imgs_karpathy`).
  For UMT-BITG, please download [MSCOCO validation set](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2014.zip) in path `images/coco_val2014`.
